# Default cache directory (public)

This directory is used by the app to store temporary working files, or any other data which it might need later and should be accessible via the URL. The path to this directory is defined as `CACHE_PUBLIC_PATH` and the URL is defined as `CACHE_PUBLIC_URL`.

If you require a private cache, you can use the directory defined as `CACHE_PATH`.
